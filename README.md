A simple money manager with React, Redux, MongoDB and ExpressJS - never go overdrawn again!

This is still in early stages of development.

## Setup
- Clone the repo
- `cd money-manager`
- Install NPM dependencies `npm install`
- Install nodemon globally if not already installed: `npm install -g nodemon`
- Ensure mongo is installed and running `mongod` (may need to use `sudo mongod`)
- Run `npm start`
- Visit http://localhost:3000 and either signup or login with username: RichardFeynman and the amazingly secure password: pw
